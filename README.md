Topological Autoencoders
========================

A Tensorflow implementation of [Topological Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00722.pdf)
inspired by the authors' own [PyTorch
implementation](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/topological-autoencoders), including calculation
of 0D homology features (ie edges in the minimum spanning tree) in Tensorflow graph execution mode.
